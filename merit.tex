\section{Introduction}
CySat is designing a nanosatellite platform in accordance with the CubeSat standard set forth by California Polytechnic University and Stanford University. The CubeSat program offers educational institutions, like Iowa State, the opportunity to design a space worthy satellite for a relatively low cost. The primary educational objective of CySat is the establishment of a small satellite program at Iowa State that allows the opportunity for students to apply their knowledge and coursework to a real astronautics project. CySat pulls students from a number of the Engineering Departments to foster an interdisciplinary environment within the College of Engineering and accomplish complex missions requiring multiple areas of expertise. Students have the opportunity to design a system and mission for a small satellite from concept to flight. CySat teaches it's members how to function within a multidisciplinary engineering team and gives them access to established industry and NASA contacts.  CySat provides a unique educational experience which helps prepare students for working in the space industry.
\subsection{Project Overview}
CySat falls under the umbrella of Iowa State's College of Engineering Make to Innovate organization (M:2:I). M:2:I is devoted to giving students the opportunity to submit proposals for engineering projects and supplying resources to help students independently fulfill those goals. Students in M:2:I receive academic credit for their contributions to their projects. CySat is an ongoing M:2:I project that has a strong history of support and backing from the department. CySat adheres to M:2:I's goals of providing further hands on educational experience for undergraduates outside of classes.\\
CySat is provided a faculty academic advisor by M:2:I and has acquired the assistance of three technical advisors, one at NASA's Johnson Space Center and two at Boeing. CySat is student run and composed of six individual teams that each focus on a specific subsystem of the satellite. CySat has developed this project structure to increase the efficiency of the teams design process and provide members with an authentic representation of space missions in industry.

\subsubsection{Project Goals}
The overall goals for CySat have been the driving force behind all design considerations and operational plans. The following were developed jointly between CySat and the team's academic advisors.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Serve as a catalyst for the small satellite program at Iowa State University
\item Develop a baseline, modular design for future CubeSat missions
\item Demonstrate the functionality of CubeSat's for asteroid surveying
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}
\paragraph{Teams}
\textbf{Structures Team:}\\
The Structures Team is responsible for the structural design of the satellite. The team is working with computer aided design (CAD) software in order to model the satellite's configurations. Structures is designing mechanical testing procedures and will oversee the satellite's integration in order to  ensure it is compliant with the structural design.\\\\

\textbf{Propulsion Team:}\\
The Propulsion Team is currently performing research to find the ideal propulsion system to use for future asteroid missions. With current information, the team is focusing on electric engines and cold gas thrusters. Propulsion is also assisting Power in the implementation of stabilization.\\\\
\textbf{Communications \& Data Handling Team (C\&DH):}\\
The C\&DH team's focus is on the terrestrial and vehicle infrastructure and software. The team is designing and fabricating the flight computer and creating a robust, automated ground station and a beta mission control application. C\&DH is preparing for the finalization of the onboard radio band, mode and hardware along with data serialization format and telemetry processing.\\\\
\textbf{Mission Analysis Team:}\\

\textbf{Payload Team:}\\
The Payload Team will lead the scientific justification, acquisition and development of mission specific instrumentation. The Payload Team is working on the development of an asteroid-surveying payload, which will detect valuable resources within an asteroid and provide estimates of the location and quantity of the material.

\subsection{Mission Objectives}
CySat's current primary scientific objective is to demonstrate that CubeSats can be used as effective tools for the asteroid mining industry. CySat is developing a payload for asteroid surveying. CySat's first mission, CySat I, will be a proof-of-concept flown in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). CySat I will demonstrate the state-of-the-art communications and radar payload, the functionality of the satellite platform, and CySat's operational readiness. CySat I's payload will map the target's density and collect absorption spectrum's to determine the target's composition. CySat's CubeSat platform has been designed to be adaptable for different payload configurations, this will allow CySat to repurpose the platform for future missions.

\section{Design Factors}
Because of the recent surge in private industry support for CubeSats, CySat has been able to capitalize on recent commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components to minimize design time and risk. The design team focused on COTS components due to several factors: flight heritage, short development time, and out of box functionality. Key components will be purchased commercially to decrease risk while some electronics will be developed in-house to increase efficiency. This system has allowed CySat to develop complex mission specific components in-house due to the increased flexibility of the commercial systems.
\subsection{Satellite Component Evaluation Criteria}
\textbf{Mass:} Pursuant to CubeSat specifications, special considerations were made to select and design components that would keep the system under the 4.0 Kg mass requirement.\\
\\\textbf{Volume:} Ensuring that components would not consume too much of the 10 x 10 x 30 cm cube, and building in allowances for a diverse range of mission specific payloads. \\
\\\textbf{Cost:} Due to the current fiscal situations of most state funded institutions, some high dollar amount components will be fabricated in house. \\
\\\textbf{Flight Heritage:} Knowing that components had successfully worked in the space environment was of great importance. This can be seen with the selection of COTS components.\\
\subsection{Design Restrictions}
The CubeSat team developed several design restrictions to guide and optimize the design early on. Since the payload will require substantial resources from the spacecraft, the design goal was to provide a robust platform with enough features to allow the spacecraft to operate beyond LEO. This strategy has produced a satellite platform which can be easily adapted for future collaborations with small businesses and other universities.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The spacecraft shall conform to the 3U CubeSat standard
\item Spacecraft subsystems should be as simplistic as possible to reduce failure points
\item Non-deployable solar arrays will be manufactured in house due to design needs and cost restrictions
\item COTS components will be used when possible to limit risk. Custom, mission optimized, electronics will be designed to increase efficiency
\end{enumerate}

\section{Science Implementation}
To accomplish the scientific mission objectives, CySat has developed a state of the art communications and radar payload. CySat is actively collaborating with the Caterpillar \& Iowa State Space Mining Operations team (CISSMO) to identify the relevant information which can be gained from prospecting an asteroid. CySat I's scientific payload will be based upon an integrated software defined radar for density and spatial mapping and an infrared spectrometer for collecting composition data. CySat I will fly the block I version of the payload which will serve as a risk-reduction pathfinder build of the software radio architecture designed for the mapping and prospecting of asteroids.
\subsection{Radar}
\subsubsection{Science Justification}
The CySat Mapping Radar (CMR) will serve as the primary scientific instrument and provide both a geodetic datum to correlate other instrumentation to, as well as returning data on the density and geological features of the target. Leveraging the flexibility of the software defined radio (SDR), the radar system is designed to provide spatial and density mapping by interrogating with different bands of radio energy as required. The application of reconfigurable hardware makes for an efficient and upgradeable platform to run radar across the spectrum as needed. By mapping data from all instruments aboard the satellite to a master spatial/density map, a total sense of the asteroid's composition and excavation viability can be assessed.
\subsubsection{Principles of Operation}
Underpinning the system is a SDR. By moving components of a traditional radio signal pipeline out of the hardware domain and into digital signal processing (DSP), a lighter and more flexible radio system can be created. All these desirable characteristic not only reduce energy and space usage on board the satellite, but also enable the SDR to function as the primary communications system, as well an integral component of the instrumentation payload.\newline
\indent Once in orbit of the target, the radar will operate as a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) where the relative motion of the satellite acts to increase apparent size of the antenna. This effect allows for successive passes of the target to act in place of a well matched antenna to regain lost accuracy and permits the selection of an antenna better suited for the chassis of the satellite.
\subsubsection{Implementation}
The CySat I mission will fly the CMR Block I. To accomplish this goal, the CMR is a synthetic aperture radar capable software defined radio for planetary radio imaging. The benefits of SDR for this experimental platform such as the flexibility in application (utilization for communications as well as radio navigation and radar mapping in multiple RF bands), reduction in system complexity (over having separate radio instruments for each function), and ease of manufacture by the reduced component count were key in selecting this approach. The intrinsic reprogrammability of the system will enable the CySat Payload Development Team to undertake progressive radar experiments with the CMR Block I until the satellite reaches end-of-life, including missions developed during flight with data from initial check-out.\newline
\indent After on-orbit activation and a systems check-out phase, the CySat I primary mission will begin. Utilizing the attitude determination and control system to maintain a pointing vector, a series of increasingly sophisticated radar experiments will be used to evaluate the performance of the CMR in orbit. These experiments will encompass simple radar ranging, synthetic aperture mapping and fail-over communications with the ground station in place of the primary radio.\\
\subsection{Spectrometer}
\subsubsection{Science Justification}
Infrared spectroscopy is used for determining the chemical composition of molecules. Infrared spectrometers have been used in many applications such as atmospheric observation, forensic analysis, and analysis of solid samples. CySat will use this technique to determine the chemical composition of an asteroid and search for minerals, metals and ices, which would be valuable resources for mining.
\subsubsection{Principles of Operation}
Infrared spectroscopy is the study of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation and matter, in the infrared range. Infrared spectroscopy provides access to quantifiable chemical information about the target. An infrared spectrometer is used to detect the light reflected by the target. When compared to the light emitted, a spectrum of the light absorbed can be produced. An infrared spectrum is a plot of the absorbance or transmittance of infrared light as a function of its wavelength or frequency. Different wavelengths of light are absorbed by different types of bonds and correspond to vibrations unique to the molecule. This allows the molecular structure and chemical composition of the target to be determined based on the infrared spectrum.
\subsubsection{Implementation}
CySat I will be flying the CySat Infrared Spectrometer Block I, which will consist of a COTS infrared spectrometer, the Argus 1000. The Argus 1000 is a miniature infrared spectrometer, designed for nanosatellites, with a proven flight heritage on multiple CubeSats. The Argus 1000, developed by researchers at York University, is currently commercially available and is the primary option CySat is considering for the surveying payload. The Argus 1000 was flown on the CanX-2 CubeSat, a mission by UTIAS/SFL (University of Toronto, Institute for Aerospace Studies/Space Flight Laboratory), and was designed to collect atmospheric spectra. The Argus 1000 has also been flown successfully on SRMSAT of Sri Ramaswamy Memorial University in Chennai. SRMSATs primary mission was a demonstration of the satellite platform and secondary was the operation of the Argus 1000 spectrometer for monitoring greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Both of these missions will serve as models for CySat's implementation of the Argus 1000 as the CySat Infrared Spectrometer Block I. The Argus 1000's small form factor, will fit easily within the volume allocated for the payload. The CySat Infrared Spectrometer Block I will provide the necessary operational experience for the team to develop a Block 2 Spectrometer that can reach the spectral ranges required to detect minerals, heavy metals, and ices.
